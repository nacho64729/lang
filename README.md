# translation practice
This is a tool that allows for translation practice from English into any of the CJK languages.
Dictionaries are `.tsv` found in `/dicts/`, and adding a new dict requires updating the `pageConfig` variable in `vocab.html`.

In addition, this tool allows for practicing Chinese vocab words from Integrated Chinese (Liu, Yao) in the "practice chinese" tab.
Chinese practice features include pinyin input and characters.
Character workbook can also be generated from `gen_char_wkbk`
