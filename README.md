# translation practice
This is a tool developed to practice Chinese for CHIN 1,2,3 offered at UCLA (based on Integrated Chinese (Liu, Yao)).
In addition, I added translation practice in Korean since I'm pretty bad at it and I wanted to practice to make my ancestors proud of me :p

Chinese practice features include pinyin input and characters.
